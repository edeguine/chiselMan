They will become easier to use as they become mainstream features. Decimate by 50% Divided triangle count by 2. Algorithm is ok but topology will not be perfect. It is instead recommended to do it manually with the subdivide brush and a low LOD. Run self-intersect check If you are going to do 3D printing you can use this to find all self-intersections in your mesh. Generally 3d printing requires you to remove all self-intersections. They will be displayed in green on the mesh. Use the Smooth tool or the remesh tool to try and remove them. Run the check again, repeat until none are left. Note: there are two versions, quick but imprecise, for a first pass. Then you can use the slow but precise one to really get them all and get a perfect score in Blender 3d print toolbox or equivalent. Attempt self-intersect cleaning Will do a slow check and automatically fix offending triangles by remeshing them. Results not guaranteed, it can easily fail. Run manifold check Chisel needs the mesh to be manifold, or in other words watertight. Each vertex is shared by all incident triangles (no duplicate vertices), each edge must have two neighbors, triangles cannot be duplicated. You can use this check on imported files from other apps to make sure they conform. If your mesh fails this check it's probably a bug and you should send it to me for review at contact@makerscape.info. Make manifold If your mesh fails the manifold check, you can try and run this to fix it. Results not guaranteed. Clean inner facets Sometimes it can happen that your mesh has inner facets (geometry inside larger geometry). This button will do its best to make a mesh that only has outside geometry with no inside geometry. This is an automated fix and best effort, not guaranteed to work. Place bone, apply skin, move bone Will display an additional tab for bone management. Very experimental but useful for moving limbs / fingers etc To use the bone system: - Layers tab > Select the layer you want. - Bones tab > add a bone, move it with the right grip in the right position - Brushes > Freeze , freeze on your mesh the skin for the bone (area of effect) - Beta > apply skin to bone - Beta > move bone, use right grip to very carefully move the bone, the mesh will deform to accomodate the new position - Beta > Place bone, go back to normal mode The user interaction for this will be greatly improved, on the roadmap. Show render tab Displays an additional experimental Render tab. This tab lets you generate path traced renders of your sculpt. It can be useful to make sure the lights and shadows work well with your sculpt. Very experimental. Do a Blender render For this feature you need a windows PC with Blender. Download the Blender plugin from makerscape.info, create a Blender scene with your FBX and set it up the way you like, make sure the layer names match the FBX layer names. Start the plugin and point to your scene and to your Blender exe, when you request a Blender render from the headset, the plugin will run the render on your computer and return it to the headset. The purpose of this feature is to easily see what the final render will look like and be able to quickly fix geometry to match path tracing shadows and such. Only matching layer names between the scene and the headset will get updated.","title":"Beta"},{"location":"beta/0_beta.html#beta","text":"Beta features are still in development but generally work.

They provide a way to manipulate the mesh. Styles of brushes The brushes can be broken up roughly along these categories: Displacement: these brushes move the vertices to create shapes. Smoothing: these brushes help make the mesh look more regular. Movement brushes: these brushes provide some movement based interaction. Booleans: these brushes let you add brand new shapes. Special brushes: these brushes have one specific function. Properties and Alt tab Almost all brushes can be customized in the Props tab for basic settings like strength, flow and shape. These settings are shared by all brushes. In the Props tab you will also find the setting related to the handling of the brush (attached / detached, follow hand movement, etc). Some brushes have additional setting specific to them in the Alt tab, things like boolean base shape, sharpness for Crease or other specialy settings. Displacement brushes Round Makes a simple round elongated bump. Great for organic shapes, sculpting faces. Flat Makes a simple flat bump. Triangle Makes a simple triangle bump. Great for sharper details, more angular features. Move Grab and move the mesh orgagnically. Sharpness can be customized in Alt. Great for bringing some flowy feeling to your sculpts. Shave Pushes the mesh against the normal. Useful for refining a shape, \"sanding it down\". In the Alt settings you can use a slower mode that tries to prevent the mesh from going inside out - not perfect though. (You will see if it happens, it looks glitchy) Dilate Dilates the mesh following the normal. Good for making appendages, nose or cheeks. Expand Expand the mesh away from brush center (ignores normal). Similar to Dilate, but uses the brush center and not the mesh. It radiates out. Pinch Contracts the mesh towards brush center (ignores normal). Great for making terrain texture. Twist Spins the mesh around the brush center in a spiral. Great for making random / noisy surfaces. Crease Make a rim or an indent into the mesh. Sharpness and curve style can be customized in Alt. Point is the default shape, point variant is more frank, point tangent also pulls in the sides of the brush, line is a straight crease line. Carve Carves the mesh, pushes the mesh outwards from within the blue shape. Shape can be customized in Alt. Can be slow. Extrude Extrudes the mesh, pushes the mesh inwards into the blue shape. Shape can be customized in Alt. Can be slow. Smoothing Smooth Laplacian smoothing, moves the vertices to make the mesh more uniform. Can make the mesh a bit flat. Smooth+ Moves the vertices to remove sharp angles, makes the mesh softer and rounder. Smooth curve Tries to smooth the mesh while preserving curvature, for instance useful for smoothing a vase or a flower petal. Smooth flatten Aligns the vertices to make a flat surface. Great for bringing in line glitchy vertices / spikes (e.g. after a boolean subtract, or a shave brush on a sharp edge). Smooth align Aligns the vertices, with more control. Alt tab lets you specify which vertices to pick (above / below / both sides). Movement based These brushes work based on controller movement. They are the most \"VR native\" brushes of the bunch. Move Grab and move the mesh orgagnically. Sharpness can be customized in Alt. Great for bringing some flowy feeling to your sculpts. Pull Put your brush on the surface of the mesh, hold sculpt and move your brush to pull out the mesh to follow your brush. Great for making branches, horns, fingers etc. Don't go too fast or the program won't be able to keep up. Flow Hold sculpt and move your hand around to make a tube. Alt lets you customize tube shape and density. Can be used to write \"Hello\" for instance. Booleans Add Adds a shape to your sculpture and merge it with the existing mesh. If you want the shape alone, creat an empty layer first. Alt tab lets you customize shape (preset or your own). Subtract Removes a shape from your sculpture. Alt tab lets you customize shape (preset or your own). Cut Cuts a piece from your mesh and lets you add it elsewhere (it becomes your brush). Copy Copies a piece of your mesh, without removing it, and lets you add it elsewhere (it becomes your brush). Alt sub Cuts a piece of your brush (brush minus mesh) and updates the brush. Use it to quickly cut out parts of your brush when using booleans. Special brushes Subdivide Applies dynamic topology without moving vertices. Useful for increasing or reducing triangle count. Paint Lets your paint your mesh (vertex painting). Material needs to be set to Vertex Paint. If you use it with dynamic topology, the paint will match the size of your brush. If you use it with dynamic topology turned-off, the closest vertices inside your brush will be painted (less detail). You can press the Y button to bring in the color picker. You can press left trigger + Y button to go into \"sample color\" mode then do a sculpt action to sample the color at the brush location (brush will collect one sample then revert back to painting) Remesh Remesh a part of your mesh, useful to remove snags, glitches and high incidence parts of the mesh. Can be slow on larger meshes. Does not preserve detail too well. Deform Lets you deform your mesh with a lattice. Grab the blue control points with your right grip (middle finger) to move them. Move the brush and press the sculpt button to reposition the lattice, you will see new blue control points at the brush location. Freeze / Unfreeze Freeze or unfreeze some vertices to lock them in place. Useful when you want to edit close or touching surfaces. When you are done, unfreeze your vertices. Show sym Lets you adjust the \"origin of symmetry\" and its orientation compared to your layer with right grip trigger. After that, switch to another brush and turn on Ox / Oy / Oz symmetry in the props tab to use symmetry. The symmetry will be based on the location of the \"origin of symmetry\".","title":"Brushes"},{"location":"brushes/0_intro.html#brushes","text":"Brushes are the core concept used for sculpting.

They work just like in Procreate or Photoshop, each layer is an independent mesh. You need to have at least one layer in your sculpture, even if it is empty. Organizing layers You can drag and drop a layer B onto another layer A to make layer B a child of layer A. When layer A is moved, layer B will be moved to. This is useful to represent hierachy, typically you if you are making a head for instance, you would make each eye a child of the head, the mustache a child of the head etc. If you need to bring a layer to the top level, select it then press \"Root\", this will bring the layer all the way to the top of the hierarchy and unparent it. Layer operations Add Layer Adds a layer with the default ball mesh. Add empty layer Adds a layer with no mesh. You can use the boolean Add brush to add a mesh. After you add it you can wait 12 seconds for the center of mass to be updated (it will make moving the layer easier) or Misc > Origin at center of mass. Delete Warning Deletes the layer and all children. This operation is permanent. The only way to undo is to load a previous save or autosave. Rename You can rename layers for better organization. Two layers cannot share the same name, so the rename will not work if the name is already taken. Copy layer Copies a layer and all children, the layer names will have a suffix to indicate it's a copy. Root layer Bring the layer to the top of the hierarchy, above any parent. Merge layers If you want to 3d print your sculpt or need it as a single mesh, you can use the merge system. Press merge layer then click on the empty space (checkbox) near each layer you want to merge then confirm. This will preform a boolean add for each layer selected and put the result into a new layer. The original layers are not deleted. It sometimes fails if the geometry is too complex. Flip X / Y / Z This will flip the layer and its children along one of the cardinal axes.

Performance : learn how to keep the app running smoothing, keeping the mesh size reasonable, or tips for working with very large meshes (500k+ triangles) or many layers. Developer's word Chisel was designed to be as easy to use as possible and provide a stepping stone to more complex 3D softwares. It is designed for newcomers and hobbyists and is powerful enough to do quality work. At the core of Chisel is the idea that as a sculpter you should not worry about implementation of the medium (the mesh) and instead focus on shapes, looks, and the feeling of sculpting. To make that vision manifest, Chisel relies on dynamic topology by default. Dynamic topology means that the mesh triangles (the faces) get automatically subdivided or merged based on the size of your brush. The LOD property controls the level of detail that you get for your brush. Another interesting aspect of Chisel is that it relies heavily on VR to let you freely move your brush and sculpt as you move your hand. This is different from tablet / stylus style controls where the brush is always applied perpendicular to the surface. With Chisel you can orient your brush in any direction and it will match the angle, furthermore, the controls are continuous, so the longer your press the bigger the bump. These additonal degrees of freedom allow for a more direct and comfortable creative expression. A particularity of Chisel is that each save is a separate file, given the large storage size of modern devices and modest size of VR sculpts, this is an opportunity for you to easily go back to a previous version. Based on my experience it's always valuable to be able to compare and undo some portions of your work. If you are worried about this, check out the file management section and how to clean up once you are done sculpting. Finally, Chisel was designed with standalone headsets in mind first. So it aims to be as lightweight as possible and use the hardware to the maximum. Still, it is possible for you to make it lag by using in certain ways (namely Subdivide only dynamic topology mode or many layers). If you have an ambitious project with many layers or very large and detailed meshes, there are still some steps you can take to sculpt comfortably and take full advantage of the topology engine.

The green bubble is where the dynamic topology will be applied, everything that happens inside the green will have the right level of detail for your shape. You can set the level of detail (LOD) in the Props (Properties) tab. The blue bubbe is a visualization of the shape the brush will make, for some more abstract brushes like smooth it's just a sphere showing the area of effect. To stay focused on sculpting, the brush fades a fair amount when it is touching the sculpture, if you need to see it, move it outside of the sculpture and you can observe its shape and size. Lock brush to controller aka Attach / Detach There are two ways to manipulate the brush, attached to controller or detached. The setting is Props > lock brush to controller The default (at first app startup) is for the brush to be attached to your right controller. This mode is ok for starters. You can press the left index trigger to invert the direction of the brush. The other option is detached mode. In detached mode, the brush floats in midair and you can move it by holding the right grip (middle finger) and moving your right controller, it's a bit like a drag and drop system. This allows you to keep your brush further away from yourself. It is useful if you are sculpting on a large mesh and want to see it from a far and don't like always having your sculpt right in your face. It is recommended for more advanced users. If you are left-handed there is a left-handed setting in the Preferences tab that will put the brush on the left controller and the menu on the right side. Use surface vertices A common issue when sculpting is having control over which vertices receive the brush action. For instance imagine you have a thin tube and a large brush. When you press sculpt, do you prefer for the whole tube to be moved, or do you prefer for only one side of the tube (the surface) to move. This is a very common scenario and there is a setting for that, the Property > \"use surface vertices\" setting. When it is off, the whole tube will move, basically any vertex inside the green bubble is affected regardless of orientation. When is on, only the vertices on the closest surface are picked, so that only one side of the tube is affected by the brush. This setting is so commonly turned on / off that it is mapped to the left controller top button (button Y). Use hand movement By default the brush picks up on the orientation of your controller and sculpts in that direction, so you basically need to find the right angle before pressing sculpt. There is another mode that is also fun that uses the hand movement, in that mode you press sculpt and move your hand in a certain direction and that direction will become the angle of the brush. It is a fun mode for intuitive sculpting but makes it harder to do precise and detailed work. This setting is under the Property tab \"use hand movement\" and is specific to each brush.

The idea is that you do not need to worry about creating or merging triangles, it will happen automatically Green bubble The topology is applied in the neighborhood of your brush, it happens inside the green bubble. All the triangles inside the green bubble are subdivided or merged to match the LOD (level of detail) that you set in the Props tab. The blue bubble has no influence over dynamic topology LOD Under the Props (Properties) tab there is a setting called LOD. It ranges from 0 to 20. It quantifies how many triangles to create based on the green bubble size. A typical and comfortable range is from 5 to 10. Above 10 is overkill most of the time unless you are doing something that needs sharp details. The crease brush needs sharp details, so it automatically doubles the LOD when in use. Dynamic topology modes Under the Props (Properties) tab there is a dropdown menu called dynamice topology. Here you can set the behavior of dynamic topology: Brush: this is the default mode, large triangles are subdivided, small triangles are merged. Subdivide: in this mode triangles can only be subdivided, not merged. Use this mode if you have a part of your mesh with fine details and you want to apply a large brush, the details will not get lost. It is recommend to switch back to Brush as soon as possible to avoid creating too many triangles. Merge: in this mode the triangles can only be merged, never subdivided. None: in this mode dynamic topology is deactivated, only the existing vertices can be moved and no new topology is created. You can use this mode with large meshes (>500k) for better performance. For instance on a large mesh, you could enable Brush dynamic topology mode, use the subdivide brush to subdivide the area, then go back to None and move the vertices. Shortcut You can cycle through the dynamic topology modes by holding left index trigger and pressing the Y button on the left controller. Notes Booleans The default boolean shapes provided with the app (Cube, Capsule, Sphere etc) do not have a lot of details, it is recommend to use the Smooth or Smooth+ brush on them after a boolean operation with dynamic topology enabled to make a nice transition and fix shading. Crease brush As mentioned before the crease brush doubles the detail for nice sharp features. If the crease brush is not working as intended try to increase LOD to 10 or more.

To serve this goal, every save action (manual or autosave) creates a new file. Quest headsets have tens of gigabyte of storage and most sculpts fit within a few megabytes, so it makes sense to keep copies around. If you are space constrained, it is possible to delete old save files from within the app (Load / Save > Manage files) Furthermore, Chisel supports cloud sync for your files with either Dropbox or Google Drive. Loading files Go to the Load Save tab and press Load sculpture. You will see the list of all the sculpts you have saved in the past. By default you will see only the most up to date version. When you click on a file, you will see a preview, click on load to confirm loading the sculpture. Note: for medium to large meshes, the preview is not shown to avoid lag. Each file automatically has a the date and time indicated as Year_Month_Day_Hour_Minutes_Seconds. Using an old checkpoint To see all the versions of the sculpt, uncheck Hide checkpoints, you will see every saved file with the date indicated in the name. Importing a FBX file from a different app You can click on the dropdown that says \"Sculptures folder\" to show other folders on the device, like the Documents or the Download folder. If for instance you downloaded a FBX file from the Quest browser it will be in Download. When prompted allow the permission dialog to access all of external storage (this is required by the operating system). Make sure Hide checkpoints is unchecked, and you can now load external files. You can import OBJ or FBX. Warning Chisel will try to scale the layers so that they fit in your field of view, but sometimes that fails. If the import looks empty see if the layers are loaded in the Layers tab and try to make them bigger or smaller by dragging your controllers while holding both grip buttons. Notes on import Chisel works correctly only on manifold meshes, which means the meshes cannot have holes or missing faces or duplicated vertices. One vertex is used by all touching triangles. After import, Chisel will perform a diagnostic and you will only be able to edit layers that are manifold. Non manifold layers will not be loaded. Compatibility with Blender and others When you export from Blender, export as FBX and make sure you check the \"Geometry > Triangulate\" toggle. Chisel only works with triangles so Quads and N-Gons are not supported. Saving files To save a file you have two options: - Press the X button the left controller, if this is the first time you save it, it will ask for a name. After save each save makes a new checkpoint. If you want to change the name, use the option below. - Go into Load Save tab and press Save sculpture, it will ask you for a name and you can save. This is useful if you want to change the name of the existing file. Export Click on Load Save > Export sculpture, it will save the file in the Documents folder of your Quest. For now you can only export as FBX. Note: if you import in Blender you will need to adjust the scale, multiplying it by 100 to 200. Deleting files - making some space In the Load Save tab, there is a Manage files button. Press it and from there you will be able to mass delete all checkpoints of a sculpt, or you can uncheck Hide checkpoints and choose which files to delete. The delete button shows you how many files you are about to delete. Warning Be careful, deletion is permanent, unless the file is synced to the cloud. Cloud sync Dropbox and Google Drive are available for syncing your files and keeping backup. To enable them go to the Cloud tab and click on Log into service. You will see some authorization screen. For Google Drive make sure you check all the boxes about sharing data with Chisel. In both cases the sculpts are synced into a folder called Chisel at the root of your cloud storage. The sculpts are made up of a FBX file and a companion .json file, the json file is only useful for Chisel (it keeps tracks of hidden layers, materials and such). Additionally you can check the auto-sync toggle to sync files in the background, or you can press sync files to sync manually. Only the most recent checkpoint of a sculpt is synced. You will see a green notification in the sculpt space when all files finish syncing.","title":"File management"},{"location":"workflow/3_file_management.html#file-management","text":"Chisel is designed with the creative process in mind and tries very hard to let you go back in time. To serve this goal, every save action (manual or autosave) creates a new file. Quest headsets have tens of gigabyte of storage and most sculpts fit within a few megabytes, so it makes sense to keep copies around.

There are ways though to tackle on more ambitious projects and work with large meshes. Triangle count / Vertex count You can see the triangle count of your current mesh as well as the whole scene (all layers) by setting Prefs > show system UI. The Quest 3 can render up to 800k triangles without too many issues, higher than that the material will influence if there is a frame drop or not. Layers visibility Layers can be hidden or displayed in your scene. A hidden layer does not impact framerate and rendering (but it uses memory - RAM). To boost performance hide the layers you are not currently working on or that you don't need to see right now. Layers > hide (next to the layer's name) Break down your sculpt into layers This should be obvious, but the easiest way to work without compromises it to use multiple layers and selectively show them. One for the hands, on for the head, one for the body and so forth. Mesh size and material If you have a large mesh (let's say >500k triangles), some materials are more expensive than other computation-wise. The cheapest materials are the matcap / clay / marble because they have very basic shading. After that the vertex paint material (PBR shading) is a bit more expensive but still decent. The slowest of all is when you activate wireframe or use the Smooth wireframe material. Computing and displaying the wires (each triangle outline) is very expensive, so use it sparingly to check your topology then turn it off. Working with larger meshes Locality At the core of its design, the app uses locality, so that only the triangles around the brush are picked up for computation. So if you want to make a high poly mesh (>500k triangles), you will get the best performance by working from large detail to small detail. First figure out the general shape of your sculpt when the poly count is low and block out the main shapes. Then once you start having a lot of triangles, zoom in and work on small areas of the sculpt at a time. If you keep your brush at a decent size compared to triangle density you will be fine. To make it lag, make the brush the size of you whole sculpt and try to sculpt, you will see the struggle. Still related to locality, the number of polys visible on screen impacts rendering framerate. If you can, try to position your sculpt so that you only see the necessary surface, everything off screen does not count for rendering. LOD and dynamic topology To boost performance you can activate Experimental > large mesh mode. In this mode the dynamic topology is not applied every frame, instead only a few times per second, this boosts performance. To boost more you can reduce the LOD (level of detail) so that your brush generates less triangles. Finally, the ultimate performance trick, but a bit inconvenient is to turn off dynamic topology ( Props > dynamic topology > None). In this mode no new triangles are created or deleted and your are just moving the vertices. Reducing triangle count and decimate Finally a last resort is to reduce the triangle count of your mesh. There are two ways to do it: - Use the subdivide brush with a lower LOD and apply it around the mesh, namely on the parts with too many triangles and not too much detail. For instance you might have a mostly flat skin surface (e.g. the neck of your character) and it does not need that many triangles, make the LOD low (e.g 3.5) and the brush a decent size and apply it on the neck surface to reduce poly count. This method is preferred because it interactive and you can fine tune the look and feel of your sculpt when reducing triangle count. Use Experimental > Decimate by 50%. This is more automated, it uses an algorithm to find flat surfaces or low detail surfaces and reduce poly count but it can lead to some weird topolgy, use at your own risks.","title":"Performance"},{"location":"workflow/4_performance.html#performance","text":"The app is designed to stay responsive even on larger meshes, but there are ways to make it lag, generally related to having too many triangles or too many layers on screen.
