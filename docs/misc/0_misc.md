Some features that don't really fit anywhere else.
## Customize workshop

Lets you customize the pedestal display in the corner of the workshop. Careful don't display a high poly mesh there as it takes resources.

You can also customize the lights colors and angles.
## Center and resize sculptures

If you really lose your sculpture, for instance if it becomes very small due to a controller lag during resizing, press this button to center it at a normal size in front of you.
## Origin to center of mass

When sculpting, especially when using booleans, you will notice the pivot point is not always at the physical center of the object. Press this button to recenter the pivot point. It will also naturally happen if you wait 12s without sculpting.
## Use tablet style movement

As you may have noticed by now, in Chisel the longer you press the sculpt button, the bigger the bump. This is different from sculpting app that use a tablet. In those tablet based apps, sculpting happens only when you move your stylus and are spread uniformly along the movement.

This setting lets you enable this behavior in Chisel to, so sculpting happens once every time you move your brush.

This setting is useful for getting some very clean creases.
