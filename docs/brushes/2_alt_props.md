These properties give more fine grained control over some brushes.

Typically you will see some options for:
## Sharpness

How sharp your brush is, how much fall-off from the center. Useful for crease, move, pinch, flat brush with rounded cube.
## Base shape

Some brushes let you customize the base shape.

For crease / flat these are variations of the displacement. For instance the flat brush has a rounded cube that is more organic that the base flat cube, it can be nice for making woodsy textures.

For carve / extrude / booleans these are the basic shape used by the brush. Whenever you can select one of those, you can also use Custom > Load custom tool and use your own mesh. Of course if the mesh is complex, the brush will be slower.

For some smoothing brushes like smooth align, these shapes are the shape of the selection aread (round vs square).
