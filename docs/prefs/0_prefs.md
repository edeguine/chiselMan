# Preferences

The Prefs tab contains some of the usability and configuration settings for the app.
## Set everything to simple mode

Resets the app to the initial tutorial and change all settings to defaults. Does not delete sculptures.
## Environment

You can choose between the following environments: - Workshop: the default sculpter's workshop. In the Misc tab you can choose to display a sculpt on the pedestal. Be mindful though, displaying a high poly sculpt is resource intensive. - Mixed reality: passthrough mode, visualize your work inside your living room. - Grid: see a neutral environment with a grid on the floor. - Solid color: see a solide color with no 3d environment. High performance.
## Add reference image

Will create a reference image canvas in the world, you can grab it with your controller grip triggers. You can use the laser pointer on Pick Image to access images in your Download or Documents folders then press load to display them. You can only sculpt when the laser pointer is not on (not pointing at a canvas), so put your canvas on the sides of your field of view.
## Autosmooth

By default a small amount of auto smooth is applied to your mesh when sculpting to keep it looking nice with good uniform topology. You can deactivate it, for instance if you want to make a rough terrain texture. In general it is advised to keep it on even a small amount.
## Stabilize controller

If you hands are a bit shaky, you can enable this, it will create a bit of lag in your movement but your controllers won't shake. You can adjust the intensity of the stabilization.
## Show tooltips

Displays tooltips on your controllers about the use of each button. You probably want this off after the first hour.
## Show controllers

Displays your controllers in app. This is useful if you are doing a recording and want to show where your hands are. Feel free to turn it off.
## Left handed

Turns on left-handed mode. In left-handed mode everything is mirrored, except for the menu and meta button.
## Use proportional movement

Turn it on to use angular based movement (so moving far away objects is easier). Turn it off for more precise, but slower, movement.
## Show brush UI

Displays the green text about general messages from the app. Highly recommended to keep it on.
## Show system UI

Displays the triangle and vertex count in the layer and in the scene. A little bit distracting, turn it on to check then turn it off.
